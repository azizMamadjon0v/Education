Here\\'s an example:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I have two classes, Person and Address. There are multiple Addresses for each Person, setup likeso (in their respective <strong>models.py</strong>)</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>class Person(models.Model):\\\\n  ...\\\\n\\\\nclass Address(models.Model):\\\\n  contact = models.ForeignKey(Person)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Now, whenever I look at a Person, I want to see all their Addresses. So suppose <strong>Persons/views.py</strong> has something likeso:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>def detail(request, person_id):\\\\n   person = get_object_or_404( Person, pk=person_id )\\\\n   return render_to_response(\\'persons/details.html\\',\\\\n      { \\'title\\' : unicode(person), \\'addresses\\': person.address_set.all() } )\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>And, I have a template, <strong>persons/details.html</strong>, with code, for example, like-so:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{% extends \"base.html\" %}\\\\n\\\\n{% for address in addresses %}\\\\n&lt;b&gt;{{ address.name }}&lt;/b&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.type }} &lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.street_1 }}&lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.street_2 }}&lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.city }} {{ address.stateprov }} {{ address.postalcode }}&lt;br&gt;\\\\n  {{ address.country }}\\\\n  &lt;hr&gt;\\\\n{{ endfor }}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I am repeating this code quite a bit, often with minor variations, such when it\\'s in a table, and then &lt; br > must be substituted by &lt; /td >&lt; td >. Other times, I don\\'t want a street_2 to display (or the &lt; br > after it). All to say, there is fundamental logic that I want to express, that I am even more loath to tote around with block-and-copy!</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>What I want is a <strong>persons/details.html</strong> with, for example, the following: </p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{% extends \"base.html\" %}\\\\n{% for address in addresses %} \\\\n  {% address.as_html4 %}\\\\n{% endfor %}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>And if I want inline table, something likeso (I guess!):</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{% extends \"base.html\" %}\\\\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;\\\\n{% for address in addresses %}\\\\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; {% address.as_html4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; %} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\\\\n{% endfor %}\\\\n&lt;/table&gt;\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The question is, then: Where is the best place to put the formatting? The logic?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Django seem to have the following (plausible) options:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ol>\\\\n<li><p>Put the formatting in models.py</p></li>\\\\n<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in views.py</p></li>\\\\n<li><p>Put the logic/formatting in some other sub-class of Person or Address (i.e.  addresses/html4.py)</p></li>\\\\n<li><p>Create custom tags</p></li>\\\\n</ol>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Help / insight much appreciated!</p>\\\\n'),\n",

It doesn't help that out of 4 people we have 4 different development environments -- 1 leopard on ppc, 1 leopard on intel, 1 ubuntu and 1 windows.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Ultimately what would be ideal would be something that works roughly like this, from the dos/unix prompt:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>$ git clone [repository url]\\\\n...\\\\n$ python setup-env.py\\\\n...</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>that then does what zc.buildout/virtualenv does (copy/symlink the python interpreter, provide a clean space to install eggs) then installs all required eggs, including installing any native shared library dependencies, installs the ruby project, the java project, etc.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Obviously this would be useful for both getting development environments up as well as deploying on staging/production servers.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Ideally I would like for the tool that accomplishes this to be written in/extensible via python, since that is (and always will be) the lingua franca of our team, but I am open to solutions in other languages.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>So, my question then is: does anyone have any suggestions for better alternatives or any experiences they can share using one of these solutions to handle larger/broader install bases?</p>\\\\n\"),\n",

I\\'m a real novice when it comes to Oracle administration and have mostly just used MySQL in the past, so I\\'m definitely out of my element.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>EDIT #2: It turns out that despite what I thought, another programmer was indeed accessing the database at the same time as me.  So what\\'s the best way to detect this in the future?  Perhaps I should have shut down my program and then queried the <code>DBA_WAITERS</code> and <code>DBA_BLOCKERS</code> tables to make sure they were empty.</p>\\\\n'),\n",

I started out by working through the <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Django app tutorial on the Django site</a> which was pretty helpful, and gave me what I needed to get started. Now I have a couple of what I hope are very simple questions:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I want to put a loop into views.py, looping over a set of variables that have been passed in from a form. So I have a load of items in the HTML form, each of which has a SELECT drop-down list for people to select a score from 0-10, like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>&lt;select name=\"score1\"&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n  &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n&lt;/select&gt;\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>So I have, let\\'s say, 100 of these variables, score1, score2, score3, ..., score99, score100. When the form is submitted, I want to loop through each of these variables and see if it\\'s been set (i.e. is not 0) and if so, I want to store that value in a suitable place in the database. My problem is that I can\\'t figure out how to loop through those variables.\\\\nI\\'m guessing that I want something like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>for o in request.POST.all\\\\n\\\\nendfor\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>but then I\\'m really not sure what to do with that.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I\\'m not looking for someone to write the code for me, really: I just would like some guidance on how to write a loop like this in python / Django, and also maybe some pointers as to a good reference guide I can either see online or buy that will give me access to this kind of thing.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Also, the select object above I created pretty much by hand, and I\\'d really like to be able to ue a loop to generate it in the template in the first place. My template currently has this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;\\\\n{% for movie in movie_list %}\\\\n  &lt;tr&gt;\\\\n  &lt;td&gt; {{ movie }} &lt;/td&gt;\\\\n  &lt;td&gt;\\\\n       &lt;select name=\"score{{ movie.id }}\"&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=0 SELECTED&gt;No score&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=1&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=2&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=3&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=4&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=5&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=6&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=7&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=8&gt;8&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=9&gt;9&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n         &lt;option value=10&gt;10&lt;/option&gt;\\\\n\\\\n       &lt;/select&gt;\\\\n  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\\\\n\\\\n{% endfor %}\\\\n&lt;/table&gt;\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I feel like there must be a way to create a simple loop that counts from 1 to 10 that would generate most of those options for me, but I can\\'t figure out how to do that...</p>\\\\n'),\n",

Help.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><hr /></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The abstract base class issue is a red herring wrt to this question, I think.  Even if Animal was not supposed to be abstract, I still have the problem that, for some reason, since the ForeignKey is defined on Animal and not one of its subclasses, the superclass method is being called instead of the subclass.  In OO programming when you call object.method() you\\'re supposed to get the lowest-subclass\\'s implementation, and you have to do extra work to get any superclass\\'s implementation.  So why is it that having __unicode__ defined on the subclasses is not sufficient for --- actually the problem might be that __unicode__ is not getting called at all because introspection on the Animal class reveals that it\\'s not defined.  So maybe if I define __unicode__ for Animal and have it call subclasses\\' __unicode__ I could get the desired effect.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><hr /></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Okay, I think that I understand the ORM issues.  Both these answers have helped me understand this, thank you.  While experimenting with this, I discovered that when Django saves a subclassed model, it does two things: (1) it creates a row for the subclassed object in the superclass\\'s table, and (2) it makes the PK in the subclass table identical to the PK assigned in the superclass table.  This PK in the subclass table is named superclass_ptr.  Based upon this I\\'ve concocted the following.  I\\'d appreciate feedback.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>Class Animal(models.Model)\\\\n  def __unicode__(self):\\\\n    if Dog.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:\\\\n      return unicode(Dog.objects.get(pk=self.pk))\\\\n    elif Cat.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).count() &gt; 0:\\\\n      return unicode(Cat.objects.get(pk=self.pk))\\\\n    else:\\\\n      return \"An Animal!\"\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p><hr /></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>It seems that Lawrence is most on-point wrt this question.  Cat and Dog will have disjoint PK sets (and any subclass of Animal will have a PK identical to the record of its superclass), but unfortunately Django does not perform any work behind the scenes a la: \"I\\'m an Animal.  I know Animals have subclasses Dog and Cat.  Specifically, I\\'m Animal number 3, and furthermore I just checked and there\\'s a Cat number 3 too.  That means that I\\'m actually Cat number 3\".  Even though this seems entirely possible and very reasonable (since a Cat won\\'t do anything an Animal couldn\\'t do itself) using Python\\'s introspection.  Thank you all.</p>\\\\n'),\n",

The number of python/django enabled web-hosts is extremely minimal - whereas I'm assuming I could drop a jython/django application on a huge variety of hosts.

The Linux client calls the OS X server without the bug (FIN ACK).  The OS X client calls the Linux service with the bug (RST ACK, and a (54, \\'Connection reset by peer\\')).  So, it looks like it\\'s the service running on Linux.  Is it x86_64? A bad glibc? wsgiref?

This report is purely just an HTML template by the way.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>In my case, each Item is part of an Order. An Order can have several items, and I want to be able to display SUM based summaries after the end of each order.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>So the report kind of looks like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>Order #25        &lt;Qty&gt; &lt;Qty Sold&gt; &lt;Cost&gt; &lt;Cost Value&gt;\\\\nSome Item          2       1       29.99    29.99\\\\nAnother Item       4       0       10.00    40.00\\\\n&lt;Subtotal Line&gt;    6       1       39.99    69.99\\\\nOrder #26        &lt;Qty&gt; &lt;Qty Sold&gt; &lt;Cost&gt; &lt;Cost Value&gt;\\\\n...

Data source is an Excel file with 80+ columns. The system has to support queries like: </p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>SELECT [question var], [demo var], count(*) \\\\nFROM survey \\\\nWHERE age in (...) AND educ in (...) [etc] \\\\nGROUP BY &lt;question var&gt;\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The data is read only, ie. never change once imported. So it does not have to be normalized too much. Intuitively, a spreadsheet-like table will do a good job wrt. speed and space. This becomes a problem, though, because questions will change, then we can't keep all the data in this table, which is necessary because of cross year queries. </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I tried normalize the responses into three tables: questions, responses, and response_values, which can support question variations. But then the response table spans over 98*14268 = 1,398,264 rows for one year! That's really huge. Query is slow like crazy! </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>How should I design the database? Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance!</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>ps. I am using Python+Django+Sqlite. </p>\\\\n\"),\n",

To solve that one, I need another field:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>class StandardLabel(models.Model):\\\\n    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\\\\n    group_id = models.IntegerField(db_index=True)\\\\n    label = models.CharField(max_length=255)\\\\n    abbreviation = models.CharField(max_length=255)\\\\n    language = models.ForeignKey(\\'languages.Language\\')\\\\n    class Meta:\\\\n        unique_together=((\"group_id\", \"language\"),)\\\\n#and I need to group them differently:\\\\nlabels = StandardLabel.objects.filter(language=1)\\\\nlabels = dict((x.group_id, x) for x in labels)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>3: Throw label text out into a new model:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>class StandardLabel(models.Model):\\\\n    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\\\\n    text = models.ManyToManyField(\\'LabelText\\')\\\\n\\\\nclass LabelText(models.Model):\\\\n    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\\\\n    label = models.CharField(max_length=255)\\\\n    abbreviation = models.CharField(max_length=255)\\\\n    language = models.ForeignKey(\\'languages.Language\\')\\\\n\\\\nlabels = StandardLabel.objects.filter(text__language=1)\\\\nlabels = dict((x.pk, x) for x in labels)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>But then this doesn\\'t work, and causes a database hit every time I reference the label\\'s text:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>x = OtherObjectWithAReferenceToTheseLabels.object.get(pk=3)\\\\nthelabel = labels[x.labelIdNumber].text.get(language=1)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I\\'ve implemented option 2, but I find it very ugly - i don\\'t like the group_id field, and I can\\'t think of anything better to name it.

I believe the real problem is that the filter <code>text__language=1</code> doesn\\'t cache the <code>LabelText</code> instances, and so the DB is hit when I <code>text.get(language=1)</code></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>What are your thoughts on this?

I have decided to implement the scheduling in a slightly strange way - the client will poll the server (every 10 minutes or so), for a list of backups that need doing. The server will only respond when the time to backup is reached. This is to keep the system platform independent - so that I don't rely on cronjobs or suchlike. Therefore the Django front-end (which exposes an XML-RPC API) has to store the schedule in a database, and interpret that schedule to decide if a client should start backing up or not.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>At present, the schedule is stored using 3 fields: days, hours and minutes. These are comma-separated lists of integers, representing the days of the week (0-6), hours of the day (0-23) and minutes of the hour (0-59). To decide whether a client should start backing up or not is a horribly inefficient operation - Python must loop over all the days since a time 7-days in the past, then the hours, then the minutes. I have done some optimization to make sure it doesn't loop too much - but still!</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>This works relatively well, although the implementation is pretty ugly.

Even if you have the rare trinity of really smart people, time and\\\\nmoney, there are still some drawbacks. I\\'ve done work for a company whose product is built on\\\\nan in-house framework. The framework is not bad. But a couple of glaring points can\\'t be\\\\noverlooked. First, new developers will always have to learn the framework from the ground up.\\\\nIf you are using a mainstream framework, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a trained work force waiting for you to hire\\\\nthem. Second, the in-house framework is unlikely to see elegant revisions that keep up with the\\\\npace of industry.

I started out with <a href=\"http://snakelets.sf.net\">Snakelets</a> and heartily enjoyed being able to control almost everything at a lower level without much fuss, but then I discovered <a href=\"http://turbogears.org\">TurboGears</a> and I have been using it (1.x) ever since. Tools like Catwalk and the web console are invaluable to me.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>But with TurboGears 2 coming out which brings WSGI support, and after reading up on the religious debates between the Django and WSGI camps, I\\'m really torn between <strong><em>\"doing it the right way\"</em></strong>, e.g., learning WSGI, spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in Django and other full-stack frameworks, as opposed to using Django or some high-level framework that does everything for me. The downsides with the latter that I can see are pretty obvious: </p>\\\\n\\\\n<ol>\\\\n<li>I\\'m not learning anything in the process</li>\\\\n<li>If I ever need to do anything lower level it\\'s going to be a pain</li>\\\\n<li>The overhead required for just a basic site which uses authentication is insane.

I tried Werkzeug, Glashammer, and friends, but AuthKit and Repoze scared me off, as well as the number of steps involved to just setup basic authentication. I looked at Pylons, but the documentation seems lacking, and when referencing simple features like authentication or a CRUD interface, various wiki pages and documentation seemed to contradict each other, with different hacks for versions and such. </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><hr /></p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Thanks to S. Lott for pointing out that I wasn\\'t clear enough. My question is: which of the following is worthwhile in the long run, but not painful in the short (e.g., some sort of middle ground, anyone?) - Learn WSGI, or stick with a \"batteries-included\" framework? If the latter, I would appreciate a suggestion as to whether I should give Django another try, stick with TurboGears 1.x, or venture into some other framework. </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Also, I have tried CherryPy, but couldn\\'t seem to find a good enough CRUD application that I could plop in and use right away.</p>\\\\n'),\n",

This problem usually manifests itself on form submission, which can be neatly worked around with <code>story_form.save(commit=False)</code>.  What about a situation where there are no forms to speak of?  In my case, I want to build an API to accept remote submissions.  Since I like JSON, and a whole lot of other messaging in our company is in JSON (including outgoing messages from this server), I\\'d like to be able to receive the following:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{ \"operation\": \"INSERT\",\\\\n  \"values\": [\\\\n            { \"datatype\": \"story\",\\\\n              \"categories\": [4,6,8],\\\\n              \"id\":50,\\\\n              ...\\\\n            }\\\\n            ]\\\\n}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>and implement a factory that converts the values to instances.  But I\\'d like the factory to be as agnostic as possible to the type of operation.  So:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{ \"operation\": \"UPDATE\",\\\\n  \"values\": [\\\\n            { \"datatype\": \"story\",\\\\n              \"categories\": [4,6,8],\\\\n              \"id\":50,\\\\n              ...\\\\n            }\\\\n            ]\\\\n}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>should also be converted in the same way, except that INSERT ignores id and UPDATE gets the already existing instance and overrides it.  (The remote submitter listens to a feed that gives it, among other things, the category objects to cache, so it can, and must, refer to them by id, but it doesn\\'t have any direct communication with the database.)</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>My real question is: what\\'s the most easiest consistent to inflate an instance of a Django model object that has a ManyToManyManager involved.  As far as I can fathom, any insert of an object with a many-to-many field will require two database hits, just because it is necessary to obtain a new id first.  But my current awkward solution is to save the object right away and mark it hidden, so that functions down the line can play with it and save it as something a little more meaningful.  It seems like one step up would be overriding <code>save</code> so that objects without ids save once, copy some proxy field to <code>categories</code>, then save again.  Best of all would be some robust manager object that saves me the trouble.  What do you recommend?</p>\\\\n'),\n",

I'll explain the specific example that I'm working on:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I have multiple abstract model classes that I use to provide small, specific functionality to other models.  Two of these models are a DeleteMixin and a GlobalMixin.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The DeleteMixin is defined as such:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>class DeleteMixin(models.Model):\\\\n    deleted = models.BooleanField(default=False)\\\\n    objects = DeleteManager()\\\\n\\\\n    class Meta:\\\\n        abstract = True\\\\n\\\\n    def delete(self):\\\\n        self.deleted = True\\\\n        self.save()\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Basically it provides a pseudo-delete (the deleted flag) instead of actually deleting the object.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The GlobalMixin is defined as such:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>class GlobalMixin(models.Model):\\\\n    is_global = models.BooleanField(default=True)\\\\n\\\\n    objects = GlobalManager()\\\\n\\\\n    class Meta:\\\\n        abstract = True\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>It allows any object to be defined as either a global object or a private object (such as a public/private blog post).</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Both of these have their own managers that affect the queryset that is returned.  My DeleteManager filters the queryset to only return results that have the deleted flag set to False, while the GlobalManager filters the queryset to only return results that are marked as global.  Here is the declaration for both:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>class DeleteManager(models.Manager):\\\\n    def get_query_set(self):\\\\n        return super(DeleteManager, self).get_query_set().filter(deleted=False)\\\\n\\\\nclass GlobalManager(models.Manager):\\\\n    def globals(self):\\\\n        return self.get_query_set().filter(is_global=1)\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The desired functionality would be to have a model extend both of these abstract models and grant the ability to only return the results that are both non-deleted and global.  I ran a test case on a model with 4 instances: one was global and non-deleted, one was global and deleted, one was non-global and non-deleted, and one was non-global and deleted.  If I try to get result sets as such: SomeModel.objects.all(), I get instance 1 and 3 (the two non-deleted ones - great!).  If I try SomeModel.objects.globals(), I get an error that DeleteManager doesn't have a globals (this is assuming my model declaration is as such: SomeModel(DeleteMixin, GlobalMixin).  If I reverse the order, I don't get the error, but it doesn't filter out the deleted ones).  If I change GlobalMixin to attach GlobalManager to globals instead of objects (so the new command would be SomeModel.globals.globals()), I get instances 1 and 2 (the two globals), while my intended result would be to only get instance 1 (the global, non-deleted one).</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I wasn't sure if anyone had run into any situation similar to this and had come to a result.  Either a way to make it work in my current thinking or a re-work that provides the functionality I'm after would be very much appreciated.  I know this post has been a little long-winded.

I'm integrating django.comments into my application, and the more I play with it, the more I realize it may not even be worth my while at the end of the day. That aside, I've managed to add Captcha to my comments, and I've learned that customizing the form is a terrible idea (hiding that honeypot is stupidly difficult, and from what I can tell requires JS to hide. Pity.). That's alright though, I've managed to work with it. However, the templates for the comments (preview and posted) are frustrating.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>When a user is sent to the preview or posted templates, I'd like my sidebar's that have dynamic data to still be functional, however they're not.

I'm more than willing to do that, and totally understand that I'm not entitled to a perfect comments system from Django. I just want to make sure I'm thinking right, and that if I want more than what I get from the comment views, that rewriting them is my only path.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Surely someone's found a healthier way though, so I thought I'd poll the audience.

I do realize that I could easily fix it by copying summary and description into create_form and loose the inheritance but I'd like to know if this is possible. </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>Why?</strong> Imagine you've got 100 fields in edit_form and have to add 10 fields on the top in create_form - copying and maintaining the two forms wouldn't look so sexy then.

The .field attribute is a SortedDict (one of Django's internal datastructures) which doesn't provide any way to reorder key:value pairs. It does how-ever provide a way to insert items at a given index but that would move the items from the class members and into the constructor. This method would work, but make the code less readable. The only other way I see fit is to modify the framework itself which is less-than-optimal in most situations.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>In short the code would become something like this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>class edit_form(forms.Form):\\\\n    summary = forms.CharField()\\\\n    description = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextArea)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nclass create_form(edit_form):\\\\n    def __init__(self,*args,**kwargs):\\\\n        forms.Form.__init__(self,*args,**kwargs)\\\\n\\\\n        self.fields.insert(0,'name',forms.CharField())\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>That shut me up :) </p>\\\\n\"),\n",

Essentially, I have a problem that I wasn\\'t able to reproduce consistently and I wanted some feedback on whether the proposed solution seems likely and some potential ways to try and reproduce this problem.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The setup: a django-powered site would begin throwing errors after a few days of use.  They were always <code>ImportError</code>s or <code>ImproperlyConfigured</code> errors, which amount to the same thing, since the message always specified trouble loading some module referenced in the settings.py file.  It was not generally the same class.  I am using preforked apache with 8 forked children, and whenever this problem would come up, one process would be broken and seven would be fine.  Once broken, every request (with Debug On in the apache conf) would display the same trace every time it served a request, even if the failed load is not relevant to the particular request.  An <code>httpd restart</code> always made the problem go away in the short run.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Noted problems: installation and updates are performed via svn with some post-update scripts.  A few <code>.pyc</code> files accidentally were checked into the repository.  Additionally, the project itself was owned by one user (not apache, although apache had permissions on the project) and there was a persistent plugin that ended up getting backgrounded as root.  I call these noted problems because they would be wrong whether or not I noticed this error, and hence I have fixed them.  The project is owned by apache and the plugin is backgrounded as apache.  All <code>.pyc</code> files are out of the repository, and they are all force-recompiled after each checkout while the server and plugin have been stopped.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>What I want to know is</p>\\\\n\\\\n<ol>\\\\n<li>Do these configuration disasters seem like a likely explanation for sporadic <code>ImportError</code>s?</li>\\\\n<li>If there <em>is</em> still a problem somewhere else in my code, how would I best reproduce it?</li>\\\\n</ol>\\\\n\\\\n<p>As for 2, my approach thus far has been to write some stress tests that repeatedly request the same page so as to execute common code paths.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Incidentally, this has been running without incident for about 2 days since the fix, but the problem was observed with 1 to 10 day intervals between.</p>\\\\n'),\n",

I\\'ve created a gallery function of sorts for my blog, and I have a gallery list page that paginates all my galleries. Now, I don\\'t want to show all the photos of each gallery in that list, since if each gallery even has 20 images, then that\\'s 100 images on a page if I paginate at 5 posts. That\\'d be wasteful, and the wrong way to go about things.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The question I have is, is there a way to just display 3 photos from the photo set? What I\\'d like to do, but I don\\'t <em>think</em> is possible is something like (pseudocode):</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>{% for photos in gallery.photo_set %}\\\\n   {% if forloop.counter lt 3 %}\\\\n     &lt;img src=\"{{ photos.url }}\"&gt;\\\\n   {% endif %}\\\\n{% endfor %}\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Judging from the documentation, unless I\\'m completely missing it, that\\'s not possible via the templating system. Hence, I can just write my own template tag of sorts to work around it. I could probably do something from the view aspect, but I haven\\'t looked to far into that idea. The other option I have is giving the model a preview field, and allow the user to select the photos they want in the preview field. </p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Anyways, a few different options, so I thought I\\'d poll the audience to see how you\\'d do it.

       "  \"<p><strong>Update:</strong> This is, as I was told, no principle Python related problem, but seems to be more specific. See below for more explanations to my problem.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I have a custom exception (let's call it <code>CustomException</code>), that lives in a file named <code>exceptions.py</code>. Now imagine, that I can import this file via two paths:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>import application.exceptions\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>or</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>import some.application.exceptions\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>with the same result. Furthermore I have no control over which way the module is imported in other modules.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Now to show my problem: Assume that the function <code>do_something</code> comes from another module that imports exceptions.py in a way I don't know. If I do this:</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>import application.exceptions\\\\ntry:\\\\n  do_something ()\\\\nexcept application.exceptions.CustomException:\\\\n  catch_me ()\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>it <strong>might</strong> work or not, depending on how the sub-module imported <code>exceptions.py</code> (which I do not know).</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a way to circumvent this problem, i.e., a name for the exception that will always be understood regardless of inclusion path? If not, what would be best practices to avoid these name clashes?</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Cheers,</p>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Update</h2>\\\\n\\\\n<p>It is a Django app. <code>some</code> would be the name of the Django 'project', <code>application</code> the name of one Django app. My code with the try..except clause sits in another app, <code>frontend</code>, and lives there as a view in a file <code>some/frontend/views.py</code>.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The PYTHONPATH is clean, that is, from my project only <code>/path/to/project</code> is in the path. In the <code>frontend/views.py</code> I import the exceptions.py via <code>import application.exceptions</code>, which seems to work. (Now, in retrospective, I don't know exactly, <strong>why</strong> it works...)</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The exception is raised in the <code>exceptions.py</code> file itself.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Update 2</h2>\\\\n\\\\n<p>It might be interesting for some readers, that I finally found the place, where imports went wrong.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The <code>sys.path</code> didn't show any suspect irregularities. My Django project lay in <code>/var/www/django/project</code>. I had installed the apps <code>app1</code> and <code>app2</code>, but noted them in the settings.py as</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = [\\\\n  'project.app1',\\\\n  'project.app2',\\\\n]\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The additional <strong><code>project.</code></strong> was the culprit for messing up <code>sys.modules</code>.
